These are the two works which we bring to take part in BOFXVI. Actually this is the first time for us all to take part in a BMS competition. Both of the two tracks are distinctive, and we hope you like them. The promotional video of *雨中* is quite cute, isn't it? And the background animation of *Crystaline* is so beautiful that you must not miss it. 

The charts are made by me, the novice. Please let me know if you have any suggestions. All kinds of opinion and criticism are welcome. 

Although we have no experience before and didn't get much time for preparing, we made the effort to do it. Hope the two pieces of work can please the BMS players. We will be satisfied if our works be enjoyed by many people. 

Thanks for your attention! Any impression of our works is welcome if you think them of not bad.

以上就是我们初次参加 BOF 带来的两个作品了。两首乐曲都很有特色，希望您喜欢；谱面则是由新手所写，不足之处愿受批评指正。雨中 的 pv 是不是很可爱呢？Crystaline 的 bga 更是赏心悦目，十分推荐。

虽然是带有试水性质的出道，准备时间也并不算充分，我们还是投入了相当的精力，但愿可以带给各位 BMS 玩家良好的体验。如果能有更多人听到看到玩到，我们就很满足啦。

谢谢关注！觉得不错的话，欢迎留下您的评价。
